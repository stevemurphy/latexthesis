LaTeX thesis template

Created by Stephen Murphy on 2009-08-20

# Folder Contents

LaTeX template for writing the dissertation or for other academic/research writing.

Some files such as preamble.tex will need to be included.

Note that style files, BibTeX files etc would be in the texmf tree.

This folder is versioned with git.
